#### Other:

These installation procedures are specific for known VR ports, for anything else or future ports, the standard procedure is to put the *vr_weaponry.pk3* package into the base directory or the specific fs_game directory of the mod (if proceeds), set the Cvar *r_znear* to *"1"* to prevent close clipping, *cg_drawCrosshair* to *"0"* to hide the cross-hair. Then for accurate iron sights is up to the VR port developer to provide the necessary engine functionality that allows for the weapon projection or hand placement and fine-tune its position and rotation.

## Copyright

Most parts of the geometry data comes from the original JK games. As a result, these meshes have been derived and translated from geometry copyrighted by LucasArts.

I consider modding geometry to be "Fair Use" - a means of supporting the games on other platforms and to improve support on existing platforms without claiming ownership of the assets themselves or their IPs. You are still required to own a copy of the original games in order to play them using this mod in any VR port of the games.

That said, using geometry from sections in commercial project is risky without permission of the original copyright holders (LucasArts/Disney), if you're a copyright holder or a legal representative of the Jedi Knight games, [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice) describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a DMCA takedown request.

With all that in mind, if you want to use and bundle this mod, parts of it or alterations of it in a VR port for any of the Jedi Knight games, feel free to do it, I only ask that you keep the original *readme_vr_weaponry.txt* that is bundled inside the *vr_weaponry.pk3* as intact as possible to keep this mod it as future-proof as possible.
